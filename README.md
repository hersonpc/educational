# GitHub Education Program

### Request for Account Verification without University Email

Hello, GitHub Education Team!

I am a student at **IPOG** (https://ipog.edu.br/) enrolled in the "Computação Forense e Segurança da Informação" program, and I am seeking access to the GitHub Education Program. Unfortunately, my educational institution does not provide students with official university emails, which makes it challenging for me to meet the standard verification requirement. I kindly request that you consider alternative forms of verification so that I may be eligible for this program, given the significant impact that the GitHub Education Program has on my academic and professional development.

### My Request

I would be grateful if you could accept other forms of documentation, detailed below, to verify my student status and allow me to proceed with the application for the GitHub Education Program.

### Attached Documentation

To verify my student status, I am attaching the following documents:

1. **Email Response from the School** ([`school_email_response.eml`](school_email_response.eml)): An official email from my institution confirming that student emails are not provided, only for professors and staff.

2. **Academic Report** ([`academic_report.pdf`](academic_report.pdf)): An academic report confirming my enrollment issued by the institution's portal.

3. **Student Portal Screenshot** ([`student_portal_print.heic`](student_portal_print.heic)): A screenshot of the student portal showing my active enrollment status.

4. **Proof of Enrollment Payment** ([`new_course_enrollment_proof.pdf`](new_course_enrollment_proof.pdf)): Documentation of payment for my new course enrollment.

5. **Current Course Invoice** ([`current_course_invoice.pdf`](current_course_invoice.pdf)): The latest tuition invoice for my current course, further confirming my ongoing enrollment.

### Final Considerations

The GitHub Education Program has been essential in my journey, providing valuable resources that have greatly supported my growth and learning. It is of utmost relevance and importance for me to continue participating in this program, as it directly impacts my academic and professional goals.

Thank you very much for your understanding and consideration.
